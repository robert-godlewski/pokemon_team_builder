# Description
Uses [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to get pokemon data to help you build out pokemon teams.

Can only do 100 calls/day according to the [documentation](https://pokeapi.co/docs/graphql).

# Running the program
In the terminal within the same directory type the following in to run react:
% bash command.sh

# Todos
* Will need to make a cache object to keep track of API data using another component
* Need to make functions to do something to return if the number of calls reach the limit.
